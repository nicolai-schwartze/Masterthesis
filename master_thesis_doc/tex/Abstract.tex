This master thesis describes and tests a differential equation solver that is based on the heuristic black-box optimisation algorithm JADE. The solver works by reformulating the residual of the differential equation into a fitness function. The underlying solution function of the differential equation is approximated by a finite sum of radial basis functions. The performance of the solver is evaluated on a testbed that consists of 11 two-dimensional Poisson equations. The solving time, the memory usage and the accuracy are compared to the open-source finite element solver NGSolve as well as similar solvers described in the current literature. To optimise the solving time and speed up the experiments, JADE is parallelised. This work adds two new solving strategies to the current solver concept: First, the number of kernels is adjusted to the differential equation during the solving process. Secondly, a new kernel is designed and tested. Finally, these concepts are checked for significant improvements by appropriate experiments on the testbed. The structure of the fitness function is investigated which reveals a fundamental symmetry. This knowledge about the function could be used to develop better suited optimisation algorithms.
