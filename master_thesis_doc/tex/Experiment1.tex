\chapter {Experiment 1: Parallel Population JADE}
\label{chap:experimet_1}

with $10^6$ FE
perform hypothesis test to show that both reach the same resulting L2 norm\\
algorithm only a little bit different: information from population not present until the next generation \\
plot of significant relative speedup \\
able to add more workers - depends on the machine \\
greater speedup when a single FE takes longer -> on which testbed pdes? 
compare time to FEM \\
