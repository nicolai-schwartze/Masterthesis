The solutions evolve over bounded domains throughout the interior nodes by minimization of nodal deviations among the population. The elliptic {PDEs} are replaced by the corresponding system of finite difference approximation, yielding an expression for nodal residues. The global residue is declared as the root-mean-square value of the nodal residues and taken as the cost function. The standard differential evolution is then used for the solution of elliptic {PDEs} by conversion to a minimization problem of the global residue. A set of benchmark problems consisting of both linear and nonlinear elliptic {PDEs} has been considered for validation, proving the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. To demonstrate its robustness, sensitivity analysis has been carried out for various differential evolution operators and parameters. Comparison of the differential evolution based computed nodal values with the corresponding data obtained using the exact analytical expressions shows the accuracy and convergence of the proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an alternative meshless approach to solve partial differential equations ({PDEs}). With a global approximate function being defined, a partial differential equation problem is converted into an optimisation problem with equality constraints from {PDE} boundary conditions. An evolutionary algorithm ({EA}) is employed to search for the optimum solution. For this approach, the most difficult task is the low convergence rate of {EA} which consequently results in poor {PDE} solution approximation. However, its attractiveness remains due to the nature of a soft computing technique in {EA}. The algorithm can be used to tackle almost any kind of optimisation problem with simple evolutionary operation, which means it is mathematically simpler to use. A new efficient differential evolution ({DE}) is presented and used to solve a number of the partial differential equations. The results obtained are illustrated and compared with exact solutions. It is shown that the proposed method has a potential to be a future meshless tool provided that the search performance of {EA} is greatly enhanced.},

Both boundary value problems ({BVPs}) and initial value problems ({IVPs}) are treated in the same way. Boundary and initial conditions are both modeled as constraints of the optimization problem. The constraints are imposed through the penalty function strategy. The penalty function in cooperation with weighted-residual functional constitutes fitness function which is central concept in evolutionary algorithms. The robust metaheuristic optimization technique of the {PSO} is employed to find the solution of the extended variational problem.

A simple comparison with numerical methods is performed using two partial differential equations to show the pros and cons of the proposed algorithm.

The target is to minimise the {WRF} (i.e. error function) constructed in approximation of {BVPs}. The scheme involves generational distance metric for quality evaluation of the approximate solutions against exact solutions (i.e. error evaluator metric). Four test problems including two linear and two non-linear singular {BVPs} are considered in this paper to check the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The optimisation task is performed using three different optimisers including the particle swarm optimisation, the water cycle algorithm, and the harmony search algorithm. Optimisation results obtained show that the suggested technique can be successfully applied for approximate solving of singular {BVPs}.},

The choice of a mollifier and of how it gets weighted, offers unprecedented flexibility to vary both the interpolation character and the extent of influence of neighbouring data values. In this respect, a soft computing method such as a genetic algorithm or heuristic method may assist applications that model complex or unknown relationships between data by tuning the parameters, functional and component choices inherent in {SI}. Alternatively or additionally, the input data itself can be reverse engineered to recover a function that satisfies properties, as illustrated in this paper with a genetic programming scheme that enables {SI} to recover the analytical solution to a two-point boundary value convection–diffusion differential equation. If further developed, this nascent solution method could serve as an alternative to the weighted residual methods, as these are known to have inherent mathematical difficulties.},

	abstract = {This is a book for people who want to solve problems formulated as differential equations in science and engineering. The subject area is limited to fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer. While making no pretense at completely covering these subjects and their relationship to variational principles and approximate methods, the book is intended to give the novice an introduction to the subject, and lead him through the difficult research problems being treated in the current literature. The first four chapters give a relatively simple treatment of many classical problems in the field. The literature is full of simple, one-term approximations, but the method of weighted residuals ({MWR}) can be used to obtain answers of any desired accuracy, and there are several methods specifically adapted to the computer. In many test cases {MWR} compares favorably to finite difference computations in that the {MWR} results are either more accurate or require less computation time to generate or both. Chapter 4 discusses the developments by Professor D. E. Abbott and his students at Purdue University on laminar boundary layer flows. Orthogonal collocation is illustrated in Chapter 5. This method was advanced in 1967 by Professor W. E. Stewart at the University of Wisconsin and J. V. Villadsen at Danmarks Tekniske Højskole, It drastically reduces the drudgery of setting up the problem, and, when applicable, is highly recommended. Chapter 6 studies the Galerkin method as applied to convective instability problems, where it proves effective and accurate. Chapters 5 and 7 relate {MWR} to finite element methods, which is a promising technique, especially for linear problems with irregular boundaries.},

	abstract = {Differential Evolution is a simple, but effective approach for numerical optimization. Since the search efficiency of {DE} depends significantly on its control parameter settings, there has been much recent work on developing self-adaptive mechanisms for {DE}. We propose a new, parameter adaptation technique for {DE} which uses a historical memory of successful control parameter settings to guide the selection of future control parameter values. The proposed method is evaluated by comparison on 28 problems from the {CEC}2013 benchmark set, as well as {CEC}2005 benchmarks and the set of 13 classical benchmark problems. The experimental results show that a {DE} using our success-history based parameter adaptation method is competitive with the state-of-the-art {DE} algorithms.},

	abstract = {A new differential evolution ({DE}) algorithm, {JADE}, is proposed to improve optimization performance by implementing a new mutation strategy {ldquoDE}/current-to-p bestrdquo with optional external archive and updating control parameters in an adaptive manner. The {DE}/current-to-pbest is a generalization of the classic {ldquoDE}/current-to-best,rdquo while the optional archive operation utilizes historical data to provide information of progress direction. Both operations diversify the population and improve the convergence performance. The parameter adaptation automatically updates the control parameters to appropriate values and avoids a user's prior knowledge of the relationship between the parameter settings and the characteristics of optimization problems. It is thus helpful to improve the robustness of the algorithm. Simulation results show that {JADE} is better than, or at least comparable to, other classic or adaptive {DE} algorithms, the canonical particle swarm optimization, and other evolutionary algorithms from the literature in terms of convergence performance for a set of 20 benchmark problems. {JADE} with an external archive shows promising results for relatively high dimensional problems. In addition, it clearly shows that there is no fixed control parameter setting suitable for various problems or even at different optimization stages of a single problem.},
