	abstract = {Many algorithms have been suggested for the shape-from-shading problem, and some years have passed since the publication of the survey paper by Zhang et al. [R. Zhang, P.-S. Tsai, J.E. Cryer, M. Shah, Shape from shading: a survey, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 21 (8) (1999) 690â€“706]. In this new survey paper, we try to update their presentation including some recent methods which seem to be particularly representative of three classes of methods: methods based on partial differential equations, methods using optimization and methods approximating the image irradiance equation. One of the goals of this paper is to set the comparison of these methods on a firm basis. To this end, we provide a brief description of each method, highlighting its basic assumptions and mathematical properties. Moreover, we propose some numerical benchmarks in order to compare the methods in terms of their efficiency and accuracy in the reconstruction of surfaces corresponding to synthetic, as well as to real images.},

	abstract = {A method will be described for finding the  shape of a smooth apaque object form a  monocular image, given a knowledge of the  surface photometry, the position of the  lightsource and certain auxiliary information to  resolve ambiguities. This method is  complementary to the use of stereoscopy  which relies on matching up sharp detail and  will fail on smooth objects. Until now the  image processing of single views has been  restricted to objects which can meaningfully  be considered two-dimensional or bounded  by plane surfaces. It is possible to derive a  first-order non-linear partial differential  equation in two unknowns relating the  intensity at the image points to the shape of  the objects. This equation can be solved by  means of an equivalent set of five ordinary  differential equations. A curve traced out by  solving this set of equations for one set of  starting values is called a characteristic strip.  Starting one of these strips from each point on  some initial curve will produce the whole  solution surface. The initial curves can  usually be constructed around so-called  singular points. A number of applications of  this metod will be discussed including one to  lunar topography and one to the scanning  electron microscope. In both of these cases  great simplifications occur in the equations. A  note on polyhedra follows and a quantitative  theory of facial make-up is touched upon. An  implementation of some of these ideas on the  PDP-6 computer with its attached image-dissector camera at the Artificial intelligence  Laboratory will be described, and also a  nose-recognition program.},
